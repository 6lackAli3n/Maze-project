# 3D Maze Project

## Introduction
The 3D Maze Project is a simple game developed using C and SDL2, demonstrating the basics of raycasting to render a 3D environment from a 2D map. The player can navigate through the maze, avoiding walls, and experiencing a first-person perspective.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6lackAli3n/Maze-project.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Maze-project
3. **Install SDL2:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
4. **Compile the project:**
   On the terminal run
   ```
   make
   ```
   This creates the executable file `raycast` (which is currently in this GitHub repository). Then run this to start up the application.
   ```
   ./raycast
   ```
